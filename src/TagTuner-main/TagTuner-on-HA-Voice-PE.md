I suggest a clear or signal white base bottom and a dark front plate with a nice carbon fibre pattern.

TagTuner on HA Voice PE is a bit smaller then [D1-Custom](https://github.com/luka6000/TagTuner/blob/ha-voice-pe/README.md) version (12cm vs 14cm) but also higher (20mm vs 16mm without the knob)

Please check the [HAVPE docs](https://voice-pe.home-assistant.io/guides/internal-gpio/#grove-port) for details 

You'll need:

- [HA Voice PE](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/)
- [pn532](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_De8uw89) NFC reader
- [grove angle connectors](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDF07mN)
- [grove cables](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEA2jSV)

We'll reuse all HA Voice PE components swaping just the enclosure
- 4 rubber pads and screws
- sliding mute switch
- LED diffuser ring
- the dial and the center button
- the speaker
- speaker and main board screws

Please read HAVPE guides on [disassemble](https://voice-pe.home-assistant.io/guides/disassemble/) and [reasemble](https://voice-pe.home-assistant.io/guides/reassemble/) of the device to know all the parts.

#### Grove wiring
You need to solder the [grove angle connector](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDF07mN) to the [PN532 NFC](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_De8uw89) board
![CA3A603C-CE5B-4982-AF24-9E40D3E554C2_1_201_a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/977e082d-af23-4d34-a981-68bd14b8df44)
Remember to set the DIP switches to 10 to enable I2C. Correct position for I2c is marked by yellow lines.

### Disassembling HA Voice PE
Use [this guide](https://voice-pe.home-assistant.io/guides/disassemble/) till step 5. Do not remove the LED diffuser (step 6) nor the dial and button (step 7) unless you want to change those parts to your preferred  color.

### Reassembling as TagTuner
Use [this guide](https://voice-pe.home-assistant.io/guides/reassemble/) starting from step 4: mount everything in your new enclosure. At step 5, connect Grove cable to the bottom port on the main board before mounting it - we want the Grove cable to stay inside.

![61F25723-1D0F-440A-8AEC-C93E8D3D49ED](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11ae2deb-b6e6-4aff-a39c-32b312fc7f8f)

Mount the main board and then the NFC reader on the upper-right screw and connect Grove cable. Check black GND wire.

Everything will fit into the new enclosure with same mount points as original.

![IMG_2968](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba3e46d3-accf-408b-8471-ecc014d5d878)

Reuse all black screws or use M2.5 screws except for the speaker.

### Firmware options

- [quick start](https://luka6000.github.io/TagTuner/#installation): use pre-built firmware with [ESP Web Tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/) powered installer [here](https://luka6000.github.io/TagTuner/#installation)
- [tagtuner-on-ha-voice-pe.yaml](https://github.com/luka6000/TagTuner/blob/main/tagtuner-on-ha-voice-pe.yaml): TagTuner riding on HA Voice PE Grove port

[Usage scenarios](https://luka6000.github.io/TagTuner/#using-tagtuner) are exactly the same as the original D1-Custom solution. \
Without nfc tag, HA Voice PE works exactly as you'd expect. \
When you place any nfc tag on the device, TagTuner takes over the dial and button: \
**Button** \
Single click: next \
Double click: play/pause \
Long click (>1s): mute/unmute \
Triple click: previous

**Volume control** \
Rotate the dial left: volume down \
Rotate the dial right: volume up \
LED ring is showing Voice assistant volume.

**Button hold and dial rotate**: change volume of the Voice assistant
