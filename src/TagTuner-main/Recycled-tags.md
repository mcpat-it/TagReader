# Recycled Tags

Ever wondered what to do with those used Sonicare toothbrushes? No? Well, you should have. Why not recycle their NFC tag?

## You'll need:
- A used toothbrush head
- A flathead screwdriver

## How to do it:
We want to remove the NFC tag, which is located at the bottom of the toothbrush head.

1. Insert the screwdriver into the toothbrush head and use it as a lever to push the tag

2. Once the tag is removed, clean it from scale and toothpaste residue.

3. The toothbrush head will still work without the tag, so you can use it to clean the tag.

4. That's it! You now have a fully functional, 'brand new' NFC tag for free!

## Using Sonicare Tags
Your new Sonicare tag is read-only. It has a unique tag ID, so it can be identified by Home Assistant. \
Simply [scan it with TagTuner](https://luka6000.github.io/TagTuner#for-read-only-tags) and check your [tags panel](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/tags/).

## The fun part begins
Use your favourite 3D models as tag tokens. \
[Low poly](https://thangs.com/search/low%20poly) figurines work pretty well.

To create a tag socket at the bottom, open the 3D model in your slicer app and add negative volume with [this](https://github.com/luka6000/TagTuner/blob/main/3d%20models/sonicare_nfc_82.stl) mesh. \
Remember to check the socket size and positioning. It should be 3.25mm high, so place the mesh Z=1.6mm above the ground plane.
